(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Well, I managed to change a few Aesthetic features on my GitHub page, but the wallpaper I chose didn't fit together nicely so you could really easily see where one image begins and another ends.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The lesson was of to a cracking start when my 2nd monitor was rotated the wrong way round and was copying what was in my 1st monitor. I tried to fix the problem myself but I eventually ran out of ideas and asked mr keen for help who guided me to fix the problem.

Apart from this hiccup, I managed to stay productive and kept myself busy for around 80% of the lesson which in my books is a success.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The fact that I waited for my blog to refresh which took a long time each time I changed even the smallest thing. This is where most of my time spent not doing work was, I was waiting for my blog to refresh so I could see If the new wallpaper change was good or if I needed to spend more time looking for a better one</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will be more productive when a change or any other change is taking a long time to put in place. I probably start coding as well so I actually have something to hand in at the end of the year.

I will probably start coding a variety of different thing so I can eventually (probably not this year) make my own app.</td>
