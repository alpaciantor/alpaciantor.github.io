(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>I did some more practise on converting binary to hex, hex to decimal, decimal to binary and all the other combinations of conversions. I certainly got better at converting hex to binary and vice versa, but i'm still not the best on it, i can do it on my own now, but i still am quite slow in doing it.

The strategies that proved effective were mostly just checks to see if i did it right like the binary final number being a 1 or a 0 check.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>My bad memory stopped me from doing the hex questions that were displayed on the wall, i didn't realise the numbers went to 9 first before going into letters so i kept thinking 'F' was 6 instead of 15.

I soon realised my problem, a couple minutes after you went through the answers.</td>

    <td>Next lesson i will firstly sit closer to the board as i couldn't see the board that well. And i will make sure to remember that in hex it goes 1-9 then A-F then it goes in the 16 column, in which 1 is equal to 1x16.</td>
