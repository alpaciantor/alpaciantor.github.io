    <td>I learned what encrypting and decrypting is, as first I had a very vague idea from a whatsapp notification on how they were "end to end encrypting all messages". I learned the benefits of encrypting and decrypting.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>not much really, I managed to do the task at hand with not that much difficulty, I personally found cracking the code was fun. I done need to work on many bad habits that were vissa Le today.</td>
