    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, and I went beyond. I did all the set work and worked on my password checker code. </td>

    <td>Well I didn't absolutely shatter every known law of physics by making a time travel device (I know, shocker right?). But i did write code last lesson that allowed me to complete this lessons starter exercise by changing the print("strings") without changing actual code.

So the effective strategy for this lesson is to do all the work before the teacher sets it and just sit there like a smug bug.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>To be perfectly honest, I don't think I developed or had any bad habits or anything that limited my learning. I mean i could always do some extra code at home, enabling me to maximise my coding time in  lesson by not having to go on python forums to find that answer to my coding problem.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will come to the lesson with a lot more coding knowledge so I can again complete the task before most people so i can (again) sit there like a smug bug (doing work in that spare time of course) and hopefully around 50% of my password strength checker done.</td>
