(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, at first i was steaming ahead in the binary part, i then did not do so well with hex as i didn't understand it but i eventually got my head around it.</td>

    <td>I learnt some technique for solving decimal to binary questions fast. I split the set of 8 numbers into 2 groups of 4 and then,  (due to mr keen) realised that the first group added to 15 so all i needed to do was to get the binary number i'm working with and subtract all the numbers that are not there from 15. I did the same for the 2nd group apart from instead of 15 i used 240.

I also learned how to convert hex to binary, i was failing at this before due to my lack of knowledge on hex and my incompatenceness. </td>

    <td>I think i did quite well in this lesson, the only things i would change is to work on my basic math skills, (that has always held me back in math). I couldn't see the board that well so it would be wiser to sit nearer to the front so i can see the questions better and without straining my eyes.</td>
