    <td>Firstly, Hello, If anybody is actually reading this then hello, how are you and i hope you're day was good.

To the actual lesson review part. Well, my github page did something and now i can no longer see any evidence of blog post 4 existing (blog post 4 is blog post 5). Unfortunately post 4 was the post with the spreadsheet and i forgot how to put a spreadsheet in a document, so yeah, that's a thing.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>As stated many times before, my lack of storage in my brain for useful information (emphasis on useful, i can remember lots of useless things like the fear of teath is odontophobia and the fear of being trampled by a herd of wild african elephants is elephobia). Anyway i couldn't re- make blog post 4,  this due to me forgetting (as stated before) how to embed a spreadsheet into a github page. </td>

    <td>I know i have said this before but i will do it this time ( probably, well, hopefully) write things down.

ON A COMPLETELY SPONTANEOUS NOTE IS MR TANSLEY IS READING THIS, YOU ARE THE GREATEST MUSIC TEACHER TO ROAM THE EARTH AND I DESERVE AN 'A' FOR THIS. </td>
